# L'Acad√©mie des Renards

This is the source code of my author website. It's a French-only website that introduces my novels, articles, and artworks. To be honest, the only reason it's public is because I use GitHub pages for deployment, but feel free to have a look. It's an Ember app building with Embroider.
